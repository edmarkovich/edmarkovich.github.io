Because of our [limitations](limitations.md) we must recognize that what we think at the moment or in general, has no deep claim to objective reality. Our instincts often lead us astray even in cases where we know better (eg: knowing that exercise is good vs being able to actually exercise sufficiently)


TODO: entry for higher-level self.

It seems that our decisions are much better where our limited monkey-brain isn't holding the steering wheel. Rather, it seems like our lives work better when our mundane life revolves around execution of pre-determined work that - hopefully - we have commited ourselves to with our higher selves.

Example: You "know" that exercise is good. And if you ask yourself if you should have more exercise in your life, some part of you will say "yes" - that's the higher self. But usually your lower self is in control - the part that looks at the 30 minute blank slot on your calendar and decides to browse social media instead of working out. So ideally, your higher self is in charge by deciding what you should be doing regularly (eg, exercise) and remove your arbitrary lower self from on-the-spot decision making.

How does your higher level self know what to do?  Isn't it subject to the same [limitations](limitations.md)? The higher order self is more likely to be attracted to the timeless and universal things than your lower self.

For example, your higher-level self is more likely to think you should read a classic book or see a classic film. Your lower level self is more likely to end up reading a tweet or watching a short produced in the last 24 hours.

Because your lower level self is more attracted to the new and the shiny, it's going to miss out on the valuable and the classic. But of course the shiny and new is much less likely to hold truth than the classic. So when you let your higher level self be more in charge and let it drive you to more long-run valuable things, you're better off.

I call this principles because that's the alternative to letting your monkey-brain decide what it should consume or do at any given moment. Principles let you create guiderails around that to steer it towars better outcomes. Usually the principles will come from outside yourself, from sources that you believe are well-intentioned and have been proven to be true. Being able to accept and operate on principles required [humility](humility.md). It's precisely the recognition that you don't intuitively know what's best at the moment that makes room for you to accept some criteria for how you ought to be behaving.

Example: you know that exercise is good but that your lower-level self doesn't make good decisions. A principle would be something like "whether you feel like opening social media, do pushups instead." That's not a thought that's naturally going to occur to you at the moment (otherwise you'd already be doing pushups rather than reading social media). It's like a little code upgrade to your operating system. 

How do we know what's good and what principles to accept? As I said, can the principle at least claim to be timeless and universal? In our example, physical fitness has been considered a virtue for millenia across cultures, and it's hard to imagine a situation in which being sick and out of shape is better than being halthy and fit. So we find it acceptable to accept that fitness is good as a meta principle and then have principles for increasing daily fitness in our repertoire.
