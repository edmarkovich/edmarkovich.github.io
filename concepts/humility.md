Humility is the lived manifestation of the recognition of [limitations](limitations.md). Meaning, that if one has deeply embraced that one may not be in possession of objective information and more fundamentally may not be capable of posessing it, how does one think and behave?

The obvious requirement is to distance between "what I think and feel" and "what is certainly correct." The hard part is to accept that even that which feels very firm, immediate, and obvious, may not be.

Example: a highschooler takes an exam. He finishes quickly because the questions seem obvious. But later he gets a zero, having fallen for trick questions. What is his reaction? Does he decide the test is stupid, the teacher is stupid, the class is stupid because it doesn't match what he thinks? Or is he humble in recognizing that what he intuitively thinks isn't adequate to produce the truth, and tries to figure out what to do about it?

Note: Judaism puts a great emphacis on study - which is a great reinforcement for one that he does not know enough - in fact one never knows enough regardless of how much he has learned.

Operating from humility makes room for us to establish non-intuitive [principles](principles.md) in our lives.
