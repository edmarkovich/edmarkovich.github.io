Your lower-level you can be thought of as an animal, in contrast to the parts of you that aspire higher.

Example: the animal part of you wants to sleep in, the higher-level part knows that you should get up and exercise to unable your long-term goals.

The animal is valuable and beloved to us. It's enjoyment is our enjoyment, it's pride is our pride, etc. 


The animal loves pleasurable limitations. The animal is happy to sleep in even if it negatively impacts our ability to exercise. The animal is happy to eat junkfood even if it negatively impacts our health. The animal is happy to enjoy distraction at the cost of family time, etc.

The things that the animal enjoys aren't in its interests. EG - the animal would be better off happy and healthy, but it doesn't think in a way that increases thouse things. Your higher-level self doesn't want to hurt the animal or get rid of it - the things it wants would help the animal too.

The Torah emphacises animal sacrifices. We don't sacrifice because we hate the animals or there's something wrong with them. We sacrifice because we value G-d and our ability to connect with him even higher than our relationship and connection with our animals - and we sacrifice despite our love and enjoyment of the animal.

Metaphorically, this is about turning something animal-like in us and sacrificing it for a higher cause. In the Torah, sacrifice reqires designating the animal, inspecting it, and sprinkling its blood on the altar (and other things.) These can be metaphores for identifying beloved parts of ourselves that we're willing to sacrifice for a higher cause, inspecting ourselves with respect to this part, and then using the energy (blood) of that part of ourselves for something higher.

I recently observed how often I miss ritual observance because "something else is going on." It seems like I have a low threshold for being distracted away from the work I know is the most important, and I accept my own excuses for this too easily.

On one hand, that isn't how I want to be. But "inspecting the animal" made me realize I do enjoy this on some level. This "distractability" makes me feel in charge, makes me feel like I am doing what I want, and it's fun to engage with whatever is happening at the moment over consistent service. So while my higher level self and this animal self are at odds, I don't hate the animal and in fact I share in its short-term enjoyment of "pleasurable limitations."

From this perspective, I have designated this animal for sacrifice. Not because I hate it, not because it bothers me, not because I don't want it around or don't enjoy it - but because the higher-level requires this sacrifice. I am willing to give up this beloved and enjoyable trait because there's something even more important.

That's the nature of sacrifice, you're giving something up for a chance of something higher. 

And going through this process, I realize that the animal is not really gone. It is infact now a real partner in the higher-level persuits. Its life force (the blood) is now directed towards the higher level service (the altar.) This really elevates the animal.

It is no longer just an entity separate from and contrary to my higher self. The act of sacrifice has elevated it clearly - it made me understand how much I enjoy and value it, and to turn its energy towards higher goals.

And the animal is infact not gone - through its willingness to be sacrificed, it has infact jointly with the higher-self entered a patter than it beneficial to them both.
