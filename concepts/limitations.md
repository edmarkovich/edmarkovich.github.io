Humans are fundamentally limited in our ability to percieve reality objectiely.

Example: if our IQ as a species was half, and we never developed a certain sense (eg: sight) it is clear that we'd not be able to understand what we know today and from our current perspective we'd not be able to understand waht we need to understan. But what is out grounds to assume that the IQ we have attained and the senses we have developed are sufficient to understand reality? Or say it another way - if another species developed 100X our IQ and had senses we cannot even imagine - that species would clearly percieve the limitations of our understanding. Even if such a species doesn't exist, we can imagine it and therefore we can imagine the relative limitations of our capabilities.

One way to recognize our limitations is to recognize that on one hand we can think and tak about [infinity](infinity.md) but we cannot lay claim to understanding it.
