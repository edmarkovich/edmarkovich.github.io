We encounter "infinity" in both religious and mathematical contexts. In Judaism, the concept of an infinite G-d is key - as is our comparitively lowely state. Recognizing that all our capabilities are insignificant in comparison to G-d is one way to intelectualize our [limitations](limitations.md) leading to [humility](humility.md).

Mathematical infinity can actually help us connect to this concept. Someone can claim to understand infninity by saying "you can always add 1 to any number" but that is just words that are associated to the concept but that's very different than actually understanding it. That's kind of like saying that "G-d's infinity means he's always been here, and knows everything" but saying this is different thank knowing how to even begin understanding it.

Back to mathematical infinity. Try to imagine infinity... For me, it's something like a visualizing a number-line that goes forever as I follow it with my gaze. It just keeps going. But is that an adequate visualization? How is it different than visualizing a very high number but not quite reaching it? Do I just trust that I can continue visualizing infinity infinitely? Certainly I can spend a lifetime visualizing such an infinite timeline. Or perhaps I can imagine counting something - but at some point I'll run out of matter to count (eg, atoms in the universe.) 

The point being is that I can talk about attributes of infinity, and I can visualize my approximations of infinity (which is really just limited visualizations that I think are closer to the concept than my daily reality) but I can't actually mentally touch infinity, I can't really imagine what it actually is life, or what it means to "go on adding 1 forever" beyond human words and limited visualizations.

I suspect that there are people who get PhDs studying infinities, and I suspect those people are more likely to say "we don't really understand them" in contrast to a regular person who says "yeah just add 1 forever." And I think this is analogous to religious people:

A child can say "G-d is infinite" but someone can study and meditate upon this for a lifetime and both know infinitely more and have a recognition that they don't understand anything.
