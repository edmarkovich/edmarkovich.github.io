It seems that the universe has underlying laws for how things work, beyond science. For example - there's a general pattern that most success requires sacrifice. In fact, things seem to work by consistent application of a sacrifice over a long period of time. That's how you raise a child, that's how you grow a business, that's how you cultivate health, etc.

It seems like the [principles](principles.md) that actually work are ones that recognize and align to these underlying laws. 

The laws can be deduced from observation - those things that work in a timeless and universal way, tend to be ones that align to how the universe works. Kind of like - we know that "gravity" is a real thing because those who understand how it works are able to build skyscrapes and airplanes, for over a century now. These laws can be understood from ancient texts - the reason those texts are still read and relevant today is percisely because they have offered something timeless and universal for previous generations that have carried them forward.

In contrast - will society be operating in a millenium based on a tweet you just read? Probably notThese laws can be understood from ancient texts - the reason those texts are still read and relevant today is percisely because they have offered something timeless and universal for previous generations that have carried them forward.
